# RulePlot of WolframModel

[**`RulePlot`**](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/RulePlot.html) can be used to get
a [`HypergraphPlot`](HypergraphPlot.md)-based visual representation of hypergraph substitution rules:

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{1, 2}, {1, 2}} ->
   {{3, 2}, {3, 2}, {2, 1}, {1, 3}}]]
```

<img src="/Documentation/Images/RulePlot.png"
     width="429"
     alt="Out[] = ... input subhypergraph -> output subhypergraph ...">

The shared elements between rule sides (vertices `1` and `2` in the example above) are put at the same positions in
the `RulePlot` and highlighted in a darker shade of blue. Shared edges are highlighted as well:

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{1, 2, 3}} -> {{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}]]
```

<img src="/Documentation/Images/RulePlotWithSharedEdges.png"
     width="429"
     alt="Out[] = ... Wolfram model rule plot with the shared edge located at the same position on both sides ...">

Multiple rules can be plotted:

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{{1, 1, 2}} ->
    {{2, 2, 1}, {2, 3, 2}, {1, 2, 3}},
   {{1, 2, 1}, {3, 4, 2}} -> {{4, 3, 2}}}]]
```

     width="808"
     alt="Out[] = ... grid with 2 boxes showing different rules ...">

Passing
a [`WolframModelEvolutionObject`](/Documentation/SymbolsAndFunctions/WolframModelAndWolframModelEvolutionObject/WolframModelAndWolframModelEvolutionObject.md)
plots its [`"Rules"`](/Documentation/SymbolsAndFunctions/WolframModelAndWolframModelEvolutionObject/Properties/Rules.md)
property:

<img src="/Documentation/Images/RulePlotWolframModelEvolutionObjectInput.png"
     width="575"
     alt="In[] := RulePlot[WolframModelEvolutionObject[...]]">

<img src="/Documentation/Images/RulePlot.png"
     width="429"
     alt="Out[] = ... input subhypergraph -> output subhypergraph ...">

Sometimes an incorrectly scaled layout might be produced due to the issue discussed above
in [`VertexCoordinates`](HypergraphPlot.md#vertexcoordinates):

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}} ->
   {{2, 2}, {2, 2}, {2, 5}, {3, 2}}]]
```

<img src="/Documentation/Images/IncorrectlyScaledRulePlot.png"
     width="429"
     alt="Out[] = ... rule plot where vertices and arrowheads are too large ...">

`VertexCoordinates` can be used in that case to specify the layout manually:

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}} ->
   {{2, 2}, {2, 2}, {2, 5}, {3, 2}}],
 VertexCoordinates -> {1 -> {0, 0}, 2 -> {1, 0}, 3 -> {0, 1},
   4 -> {-1, 0}, 5 -> {2, 1}}]
```

<img src="/Documentation/Images/RulePlotWithCustomCoordinates.png"
     width="429"
     alt="Out[] = ... rule plot with reduced sizes for vertices and arrowheads ...">

Some of the [`HypergraphPlot`](HypergraphPlot.md) options are supported,
specifically [`GraphHighlightStyle`](HypergraphPlot.md#graphhighlight-and-graphhighlightstyle)
, [`"HyperedgeRendering"`](HypergraphPlot.md#hyperedgerendering)
, [`VertexCoordinates`](HypergraphPlot.md#vertexcoordinates), [`VertexLabels`](HypergraphPlot.md#vertexlabels)
, [`VertexSize`, `"ArrowheadLength"`](HypergraphPlot.md#vertexsize-and-arrowheadlength),
and [style options](HypergraphPlot.md#style-options). `"EdgeType"` is supported as an option instead
of [the second argument](HypergraphPlot.md#edge-type) like in [`HypergraphPlot`](HypergraphPlot.md).

There are also two additional `RulePlot`-specific style options. **`Spacings`** controls the amount of empty space
between the rule parts and the frame (or the space where the frame would be if it's not shown):

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{{1, 2}} -> {{1, 3}, {1, 3}, {3, 2}},
   {{1, 2}, {1, 2}} -> {{1, 3}, {3, 2}}}], Spacings -> 0.03]
```

     width="747"
     alt="Out[] = ... plot of 2 rules with tight spaces between the rules and the frame ...">

**`"RulePartsAspectRatio"`** is used to control the aspect ratio of rule sides. As an example, it can be used to force
rule parts to be square:

```wl
In[] := RulePlot[WolframModel[{{1, 2}} -> {{1, 3}, {1, 3}, {3, 2}}],
 "RulePartsAspectRatio" -> 1]
```

     width="429"
     alt="Out[] = ... rule plot with square rule parts ...">
