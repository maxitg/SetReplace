# Plots of Events

The plotting function corresponding to [`"AllEventsStatesList"`](States.md) is more interesting than the other
ones. **`"EventsStatesPlotsList"`** plots not only the states, but also the events that produced them:

```wl
In[] := WolframModel[{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {1, 4}} ->
  {{2, 7, 8}, {3, 9, 10}, {5, 11, 12}, {6, 13, 14}, {8, 12}, {11,
    10}, {13, 7}, {14, 9}},
 {{1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}},
 3, "EventsStatesPlotsList"]
```

     alt = "Out[] = {
       ... 9 consecutive state plots with single events in between, with edges about to be deleted highlighted as dotted
       gray, and edges just created highlighted in red ...
     }">

Here the dotted gray edges are the ones about to be deleted, whereas the red ones have just been created.
